This is the website for **"Interactive web-based data visualization with R, plotly, and shiny"**. In this book, you'll gain insight and practical skills for creating interactive and dynamic web graphics for data analysis from `R`. It makes heavy use of **plotly** for rendering graphics, but you'll also learn about other `R` packages that augment a data science workflow, such as the [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and [**shiny**](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). Along the way, you'll gain insight into best practices for visualization of high-dimensional data, statistical graphics, and graphical perception. By mastering these concepts and tools, you'll impress your colleagues with your ability to *generate more informative, engaging, and repeatable interactive graphics* using free software that you can share over email, export to pdf/png, and more.
